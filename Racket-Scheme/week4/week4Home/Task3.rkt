#lang racket

#|
The depth of an atom *x* in a list *xs*
is the number of times *car* must be applied
to *xs* in order to reach *x*.
Define a procedure that removes all atoms that are smaller than their depth.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. All tests pass.

(define (deep-delete xss)
  (define (helper depth leftover-xss)
    (cond
      [(null? leftover-xss) null]
      [(list? (car leftover-xss)) (append
                                   (list (helper (add1 depth) (car leftover-xss)))
                                   (helper depth (cdr leftover-xss)))]
      [(< (car leftover-xss) depth) (helper depth (cdr leftover-xss))]
      [else (cons (car leftover-xss) (helper depth (cdr leftover-xss)))]
      )
    )
  (helper 1 xss)
  )

; can reach "1" by applying "car" one time and "2" can be reached with "caadr".
